        <p>Making your own <strong>natural</strong> products can a be fun, <strong>healthy</strong> and less expensive way to take care of your skin and hair. Most of the commercial products you use on your skin, hair, face or body contain chemicals that are unhealthy and damaging. Almost all of these products can be replaced by a homemade, <strong>all-natural</strong> recipe. </p>

                <p>Guess what? You don't need to buy Head & Shoulders to fix a flaky scalp. In fact, most anti-dandruff shampoos can make your scalp dependant on their chemical stripping, which is why it never goes away. There are many safer, less expensive alternatives to get rid of dandruff – for good. </p>
