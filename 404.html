        	<h3>Shampoo's history.</h3>
        	<p>In the 1800s, the word <em>shampoo </em> was comonly used to describe the process of massaging one's hair, often with soap and herbs boiled in soda water. The first dictionary definition of shampoo (in 1860) was a verb: "to wash oneâ€™s hair". In 1866, it changed to "the soap used to wash one's hair." </p>

           <h3>Turn of the century.</h3>

He developped and hair products in his Berlin drugstore. The popularity of such shampoos increased quickly. In 1908 an article published in the New York Times annouced that for women, shampoo was necessary to be clean, beautiful and well-respected. It recommended that women shampoo at approximately twice a month.</p>
