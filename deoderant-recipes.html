Here are some easy, natural recipes you can make to replace your current deoderant.</p>

          <h2>Coconut Oil Deoderant</h2>
			<h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup (55 g) baking soda (sodium bicarbonate)</li>
                <li>1/4 cup (32 g) cornstarch</li>
                <li>10 drops tea tree oil</li>
                <li>2+ tbsp (30 g) coconut oil, melted</li>
            </ul>
            
            
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            
            <ol>
            <li>Combine the baking soda, cornstarch and tea tree oil in a bowl.
            
            <ul>
            <li>Mix well using a whisk or fork.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Add the coconut oil.
            
            <ul>
            <li>Stir until the mixture is smooth. If you are adding optional skin soothers like Vitamin E or sweet almond oil, add it during this step.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Press the mixture into the deodorant stick container.
            
            <ul>
            <li>Make sure the base is twisted all the way down to the bottom. It may seem soft at first, but should set up after a few days.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>(Optional) Adding fragrance. You can easily vary the fragrance of your deodorant by using different essential oils in place of the tea tree oil.
            
            <ul>
            <li>Lavender, rose, eucalyptus or sandalwood are good choices because they share the anti-bacterial properties of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>Chamomile, a known skin soother, would also work well.</li>
            <li>Start with just a few drops. Add a little more at a time until your deodorant has the scent you want.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Use your deodorant. Apply this deodorant in the same manner you would the store-bought kind. A little goes a long way, so use a lighter hand than you usually would.</li>
            </ol>
