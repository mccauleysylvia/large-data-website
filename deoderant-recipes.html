        	<h2 id="main" role="main">Coconut Oil Deoderant</h2>
        	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
            	<ul>
                    <li>1/4 cup (55 g) baking soda (sodium bicarbonate)</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup (32 g) cornstarch</li>
                    <li>10 drops tea tree oil</li>
                    <li>2+ tbsp (30 g) coconut oil, melted</li>
            	</ul>
          	<h3>Instructions</h3>
            
            <ol>
            	<li>Combine the baking soda, cornstarch and tea tree oil in a bowl.
            
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mix well using a whisk or fork.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                    
                <li>Add the coconut oil.                
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Stir until the mixture is smooth. If you are adding optional skin soothers like Vitamin E or sweet almond oil, add it during this step.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                    
                <li>Press the mixture into the deodorant stick container.
                    <ul>
                    	<li>Make sure the base is twisted all the way down to the bottom. It may seem soft at first, but should set up after a few days.</li>
                    </ul>
                 </li>
                 
                 <li>(Optional) Adding fragrance. You can easily vary the fragrance of your deodorant by using different essential oils in place of the tea tree oil.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Lavender, rose, eucalyptus or sandalwood are good choices because they share the anti-bacterial properties of tea tree oil.</li>
                        <li>Chamomile, a known skin soother, would also work well.</li>
                        <li>Start with just a few drops. Add a little more at a time until your deodorant has the scent you want.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li>Use your deodorant. Apply this deodorant in the same manner you would the store-bought kind. A little goes a long way, so use a lighter hand than you usually would.</li>
            </ol>
