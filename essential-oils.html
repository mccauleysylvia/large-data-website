        <p>An essential oil is a concentrated liquid extracted from plants. An oil is <em>essential</em> in the sense that it carries a distinctive scent, or essence, of the plant. Many of them can be added to recipes as part of a natural skincare routine. They each have different medicinal purposes, and they smell nice too! It is very important to do research before using essential oils, as they can be harmful to your skin if not used properly. </p>
